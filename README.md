# Cola_Plot
This chart was created to replace the pots on the chart with an image.  To create a more dynamtic type of chart.  I wanted to create the size of the image based on the amount of sugar in the cola brand.

# GG Plot 2 Baby!!
I used ggplot2 for this image.  I created the data from a basic search on the cola cans and got the images from the google image search.  The chart is not preety, but I was able to create the size of the can based on teh sugar amount in the can.  


## Here is the beautiful chart !!

I wanted to do more with this, but not sure where to go on this.  Maybe some other data.
